Saipan needs a technology program


For far too long saipan's greatest export has been its youth. Our goal is to change that. No longer will students have to choose between leaving home and fulfilling their potential.

Saipan institute will:

1. Allow students to develop their capabilities and carees without leaving the island

2. Ensure alumni have high-paying jobs

3. Connect students with the people needed to start their companies of their own
